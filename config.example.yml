# configuration settings for bibframe validation
# copy this file to config.yml and change the settings as necessary
#
# In order to make these tests agnostic for marc -> bibframe processing, the
# idea is that a helper method will be provided to get from an inline (known)
# marc record (as marcxml) to an RDF::Graph object holding bibframe triples.
#
# For example, look at spec/support/m2bf_xquery_helpers.rb.  This class provides
#  the marc_to_graph_m2bf_xquery method.  The lines below pertain to the config
#  info needed by marc_to_graph_m2bf_xquery in m2bf_xquery_helpers.rb
#
# To run the specs, the config.yml file must have the appropriate configuration
# information for the helper method that will be used. See README for more
# information.

helper_method: marc_to_graph_m2bf_xquery
