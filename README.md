# Bibframe Work Validation

This project is focused on validating properties of bibframe Works and perhaps some bibframe Instances.  Ruby RSpec is used as a means of validating the properties of data in the Bibframe model.  We want evaluation code that can be run against bibframe resources to determine the quality of the conversion process.

Of particular interest:

* multiple works in a single marc record
* work properties to facilitate reconciliation with references to the same work in larger graphs (e.g.  data in a collection, or data in the Stanford libraries, or data known to OCLC, or data in the cloud)
* multiple instances in a single marc record
* instance properties to facilitate reconciliation ...

This project should help us evaluate the quality of bibframe produced by different converters.  https://github.com/lcnetdev/marc2bibframe is the current reference implementation, but we expect other converters will appear.  This project doesn't run the converters;  it provides a mechanism for evaluating the resulting bibframe, presumably represented in a serialized RDF graph.

# The data

See spec/fixtures

xxx.marcxml are MARC records from Stanford - provided for reference and for use by conversion programs.

xxx.rdfxml is the output from https://github.com/lcnetdev/marc2bibframe run against the .marcxml records

xxx.ttl is a turtle representation of the same data as the .rdfxml file -- provided for human readability.

The specific marc records were chosen to try to exercise different wrinkles in work/instance information present in a single marc record.  As new work-instance wrinkles are surfaced, marc records and specs should be added to the project.

# The specs

Given known marc data, we should be able to describe exactly what we expect to be present in bibframe.

For example, we may know that a certain marc record should produce 4 works, with one instance for each work.  Another marc record might have only 1 work and 1 instance.

We also know that we would like to reconcile a work generated by a converter against existing works in existing RDF data, so data that facilitates this (e.g. standard numbers, titles, creators, publisher, pub date ...) is highly desirable as well.  Given specific marc data, we can test for specific information in titles, standard numbers, etc. in the bibframe resource.
